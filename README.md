# Amazon Access

It is a project of Analysis of the Amazon Employees who will get the access in the office or not.
We build the Model to predict the access of any employee by its own we tried with models such as:
* CatBoost Classifier
* CatBoost cvfold Classifier
Note that our target column (ACTION) contains 30872 1s and only 1897 0s. So we have to do the data balancing also.
